**Choose Your Own Adventure : The Phoenix**
<!-- A description of your game. Background info about why you chose the game is a nice touch. -->


**Goal of the Game**
The goal of the game is to have found three phoenix feathers before the timer runs out, and by the time you get to the end of the game, to earn the chance to find the phoenix.


**How to Choose Your Own Adventure**
In each scenerio, you’re in an environment in which you’re tasked to find one phoenix feather BEFORE moving on.  You will be given one clue per environment.

(You may choose not to search for a feather and move on. However, this will eliminate your chance to ultimately find the phoenix at the end.  If you only care about staying alive, this is an option.)

After finding the feather (or choosing not to), you will be given 2 choices of next environments to search for another feather. Choose wisely, or you may go up in flames!

If your choice results in a warning that you are are going up in flames, you will be able to “spend” the feather you found previously for another chance at life (and move into a safe environment).  If you do not have any feathers, you will go up in flames directly.

With the last environment, if you have 3 feathers you have the opportunity to search for the phoenix. If you have less than 3, well... at least you’re still alive!
