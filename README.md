# Choose Your Own Adventure : The Phoenix
<!-- ![Game-Image](/images/ThePhoenixScreenshot.png) -->


 ## Goal of the Game
The goal of the game is to have found three feathers before the timer runs out, and at the end earn the chance to find the phoenix.<br>
<br>
 ## How to Choose Your Own Adventure

 1. Upon arriving to each scenerio, you will have the opportunity to find a feather BEFORE making the choice for the next scenerio. Hovering over the scenerio will allow you to find it.<br>

 2. The feathers you collect will give you a boon, that when consumed will save you from a perilous choice. Choose wisely!<br>

 3. It is not required to search for a feather, but without all three it will be impossible to find the phoenix.<br>
