**Choose Your Own Adventure : The Phoenix**
<!-- A description of your game. Background info about why you chose the game is a nice touch. -->


**Goal of the Game**
  The goal of the game is to have found three phoenix feathers before the timer runs out, and by the time you get to the end of the game, to earn the chance to find the phoenix.


**How to Choose Your Own Adventure**
  You are on a journey to find the mythical phoenix.

  You will pass through three scenerios, upon arriving you will have the opportunity to find one feather BEFORE moving on. Hovering in the image will lead you to it, click when you see the highlight.

  You have two choices to move forward, one will be fatal.

  It is not required to search for a feather, but without collecting all three you cannot move forward to find the phoenix.

  The feathers will resurrect you if you make a perilous choice, but each time one will be deducted.

  You have one minute to find all three feathers and the phoenix.
